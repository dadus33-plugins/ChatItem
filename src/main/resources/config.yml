# By default, it's in "both" mode.
#
# Available mode :
# - "both" : Prevent chat editing with multiple plugins by using all ways possible to edit the chat.
# - "auto" : Choose automatically between all available according to actual plugins.
# - "packet" : The working system for 1.4's ChatItem version (and older)
#        It was working with lot of others chat plugin, specially those who made hover text.
# - "chat" : New system which works without other chat plugin, which is simpler and with lower
#        amount of possible issues.
# You can replace 'both' by another mode that should correspond to what you want.
# If you don't know which one use, come on discord (link at begin of config or in spigotmc)
